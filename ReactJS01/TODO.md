# TODO: Fix React App Blank Page Issue

## Changes Made:
- Set VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8888 in .env.development
- Downgraded React to 18.2.0, react-dom to 18.2.0, react-router-dom to 6.8.0 for stability
- Updated @types/react and @types/react-dom to match
- Added 5-second timeout to axios to prevent hanging requests
- Restored full HomePage with song display functionality
- Restored AuthWrapper in main.jsx and full App.jsx with context
- Restored Header.jsx with AuthContext for login/logout

## Next Steps:
1. Ensure backend is running on port 8888
2. Restart React dev server
3. The app should now display songs, allow login, and navigate properly

## Fixes Applied:
- Fixed JavaScript syntax errors in home.jsx (debounce function, missing import for getFavoritesApi)
- Corrected handleFilterChange to trigger debounced fetch on filter changes
- Updated debouncedFetchSongs dependencies

## If issues:
- Check backend is running: cd ExpressJS01 && npm start
- Check console for errors
- Ensure VITE_BACKEND_URL is set
